  The era of Mobile Technology opens the windows to the Android app.
  The websites are vanishing, and the mobile apps are emerging.
  It's time to change from the conventional websites to mobile apps which has become the part of our daily routine.
  College updates are not reaching the students which leads to communication gap between college management and students.
  The proposed solution is about developing an Android application which would be a miniature of our college website.
  It works as a small college management software. This application will be used by faculty, students and others.
  It is also helpful for parents to know about the college. Students can get notifications regarding results, events
  and latest technical news. Through this college app, every student will get the complete
  details of all issues going in and around the college.
  The college app will be a one click process to get the details of college into our hand.
